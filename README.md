# distortion-effect-giver
i made a simple GUI that can add a distortion effect to your mp3 file so you can play copy right songs live with out getting noticed.

you can add mp3 files from the add MP3s button
and if it doesn't work then you can put your own hard coded MP3 file into (HARDCODED_FILE = r"") section
i will add a loop button later but for now let me know what you guys think.
and what else i sould add.
(make sure to pip install)
